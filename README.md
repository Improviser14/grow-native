Basic fullStack Node blog webApp (MEN stack) template

Rose Javier's blog about Native Virginia Plants and related topics.

This is a fullStack webApp that uses Node.js with the Express.js framework and MongoAtlas as the database.

On the front-end, the trinity is used of course (javaScript, HTML5, CSS3) as well as the Bootstrap and SemanticUI frameworks.
